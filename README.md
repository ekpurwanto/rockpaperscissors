The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model was developed to perform hand gesture recognition using the rock-paper-scissors dataset. This dataset specifically focuses on hands with a green background, which introduces a unique challenge. When attempting to predict hand gestures in photos with different backgrounds (non-green backgrounds), the model tends to exhibit signs of overfitting.

Despite this challenge, the CNN model achieved an impressive accuracy rate of 97%. This level of accuracy was achieved with relatively quick training sessions, typically taking around 23 minutes to complete in Google Colab. This remarkable performance underscores the robustness and effectiveness of the model in recognizing and distinguishing rock, paper, and scissors hand gestures, even in less ideal conditions.
